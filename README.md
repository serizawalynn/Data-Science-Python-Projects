# Python_Projects
Portfolio for my Python projects. A majority of these were completed through Codecademy's Data Scientist career path certificate program. These notebooks are written by the instructors and are meant to be filled out by the student. Thus, they are fully annotated.

The rest of the ipynb files are notebooks that I have written.

The following files are notebooks I have written for Kaggle competitions:
ls-aug(1).ipynb
ls-july-2022.ipynb
