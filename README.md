# Data Science Python Projects
Portfolio for my Python projects. 
**date-a-scientist.ipynb** is a data science project that I did that classifies individual's relationship status based on the information on their profile. This was done through Codecademy's Data Scientist career path program that I did during my gap year due to COVID. These notebooks are written by instructors and are meant to be filled out by the student. Thus, they are fully annotated.

**Data Cleaning for Global Mental Health Trends.ipynb** is a note that I used for data cleaning for a Tableau data viz. Here, I used Pandas to clean up the dataset. You can see my Tableau visualizations via my Tableau public profile: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lynn6821



The rest of the ipynb files are notebooks that I have written.

The following files are notebooks I have written for Kaggle competitions:
